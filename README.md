# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Student-Retention
The project analyzes student data to predict dropouts based on academic performance, socio-economic background, and entrance exams. Using Excel, Python, and Tableau, I have applied five machine learning models to classify students as eligible or at risk, helping university management intervene and improve student retention.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student data to predict potential dropouts based on various factors, such as prior academic performance, socio-economic background, and entrance exam results. By understanding the factors that contribute to student success and identifying at-risk students, we aim to help university management intervene early and improve student retention rates. The primary objective of this project is to perform a risk analysis of students and determine those who are likely to drop out based on their academic performance. Predicting dropouts can help universities take proactive measures to retain students and support their academic success.

# Scope of the Project
I aim to build a classification model that predicts the eligibility of students, specifically identifying those at risk of dropping out considering:

-Prior academic performance
-Current grades
-Socio-economic backgrounds
-Entrance exams
These factors help classify students as either "eligible" or "not eligible" (i.e., at risk of dropout). This information can assist university management in devising programs to support at-risk students.

# Tools and Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration and manipulation.
- Python: For data profiling, cleansing, and modeling using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- Tableau: For data visualization and presenting insights.

# Data Analysis Process
-Data Profiling & Cleansing: The dataset, "18 Batch-Master Data" with 1299 records, was profiled and cleansed using Python libraries to ensure data quality.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the data to discover patterns and relationships between key attributes such as student performance and dropout rates.
-Feature Engineering: Identified key features affecting student performance and prepared the dataset for modeling.

# Classification Models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Each model's performance was evaluated based on benchmarking parameters to determine the best-performing algorithm.

# Results
The project concludes with identifying factors that influence student dropout rates and provides a classification model to help university management intervene for students at risk. The models and findings are presented using Tableau visualizations for better understanding and actionable insights.
